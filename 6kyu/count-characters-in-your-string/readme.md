# Count characters in your string
https://www.codewars.com/kata/52efefcbcdf57161d4000091

The main idea is to count all the occuring characters(UTF-8) in string. If you have string like this `aba` then the result should be `{ 'a': 2, 'b': 1 }`

What if the string is empty ? Then the result should be empty object literal `{ }`
